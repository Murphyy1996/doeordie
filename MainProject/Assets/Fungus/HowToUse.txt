Using Fungus:

1) Create a flowchart (Tools > Fungus > Create > Flowchart)
2) To open up the flowchart window click on the flowchart in the hierachy and find the button in the inspector that says "Flowchart Window". OR 
Tools > Fungus > Flowchart Window.
3) To add a command i.e make it say "hello world" on start up - click the default box given to you for the start of the game (in the flowchart) and 
in the inspector click "commands" and add a "say" command (by clicking the plus symbol, going down to narrative and choosing say). 
* You can add several lines of speech etc to one box in the same way. 
4) To add a choice you do the same thing as above by going into narrative and then choosing a menu instead.
5) You will need to add extra boxes for the conversation direction to start going if a certain choice is made. - To add more choices you add more menus and more blocks
for the conversation to move to if that choice is selected.
* You can drag boxes to rearragne them and organise them. - You can also zoom out using a scrollbar on the flowchart window.
6)If you need more than one flowchart to keep it cleaner - you can use the "call" command on a box to call a box from another flowchart. (If you make more than one flowchart
make sure to turn off all the game starting boxs' except the one you want the game to start on - otherwise they conflict).

EVENTS

(You can add things such as camera shake and audio to play when certain dialogue is said but I already know how to do this so ask and I can show you).
